Please replace process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_URL || 'http://localhost:3001' with your actual server URL. The process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_URL is an environment variable that you can set in your .env file in the root of your React project like this: REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=https://your-server-url.com.

Also, remember to build your React app for production using the npm run build (or yarn build) command and configure your server to serve the static files from the build directory.

CORS: If your client and server are not on the same domain in your production environment, you will need to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). This has to be handled on the server-side (as discussed in the previous message), but you also need to ensure that your client-side code is set up to handle any CORS preflight requests correctly.
